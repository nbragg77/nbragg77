- 👋 Hi, I’m @nbragg77 or you can call me Nate
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I possibly can as I change career paths
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and the next steps will be R, SQL, and the various tools/libraries for data analytics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at this point, just getting my feet wet and learning github
- 📫 How to reach me ...
